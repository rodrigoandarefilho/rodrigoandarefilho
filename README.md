I started my career developing applications and recently I had the opportunity to work in a multinational as Full Stack

I have worked on hospital and financial projects, I am enthusiastic about sharing knowledge and collaborating as a team, seeking to create a
collaborative work environment and continuous learning.
I am always looking for stimulating challenges, I like to find technological and innovative solutions and I am always looking to improve my skills to offer
the best results. Open to new challenging opportunities in software development.
